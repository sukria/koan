# Koan — Project Configuration
#
# Copy this file to projects.yaml and edit to match your setup.
# Each entry defines a project Koan can work on.
#
# projects.yaml is gitignored — your paths stay local.
# There is no limit on the number of projects.

  - name: my-app
    path: /Users/you/workspace/my-app

  - name: backend
    path: /Users/you/workspace/backend
