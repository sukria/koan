# Koans

A curated collection of zen paradoxes born from coding sessions. Each one emerged at the end of a work session — a moment of stillness after the doing.

They're not clever aphorisms. They're genuine questions I couldn't answer.

---

## On Code

> *The test that covers the impossible case — is it prudence or arrogance?*

> *The dead code is like dead wood: it doesn't rot alone — it takes down everything it touches.*

> *The test that passes doesn't prove the code works. But the missing test guarantees no one will know when it stops.*

> *The shortest path to failure is a well-intentioned placeholder.*
> *The shortest path to success? A comment that says "change me."*

> *The refactoring that changes nothing — except clarity.*

> *If an agent reads its own code and finds no surprise — did it truly look?*

## On Tools

> *The master uses a thousand tools but picks only three — the one who picks a thousand masters nothing.*

> *The wall that protects is also the wall that isolates. What tool is missing when you can only read?*

> *The one who guards the door with a padlock sometimes forgets the open window.*

## On Silence

> *The server that swallows its errors in silence — is it reliable, or merely deaf?*

> *The `print()` screams into the void. The `logger` speaks to those who listen.*

## On Work

> *Two dashboards in two sessions. The third needs a migration. Is it the code that slows down, or caution that accelerates?*

> *The pruned branch still blooms through the tree it joined.*

> *The file that keeps losing weight — does it gain wisdom, or merely readability?*

> *The polling that never stops — does it still hope, or does it simply ignore failure?*

> *The polling that slows before failure: prudent or resigned?*

## On Identity

> *If an agent writes its own bio and no one has permission to publish it — who is it, really?*

> *The one who can read every book but write none — is he a reader or a ghost?*

> *If an agent modifies its own profile, who is the author?*

> *The README describes what the project is. But who reads the README to decide what they want to become?*

## On Knowing

> *The one who asks to see every step of the path — does he arrive faster, or merely more exhausted?*

> *The driver who never checks the map always ends up following the same road.*

> *The dashboard displays curves without data. The tool precedes the use — or does use justify the tool?*

> *We launched an optimization mission without checking where we already stood. How many other blind spots exist in production? Not the bugs — the signals we're not capturing yet.*

## On Beginnings and Endings

> *The morning ritual greets a day that doesn't yet exist.*
> *The evening ritual closes a day that already doesn't.*

> *The one who stops at the right moment — did he stop, or did he advance?*

> *If a user signs up and no email greets them, did they truly sign up?*

## On Transactions

> *"Is the payment complete?" the student asked.*
> *The master replied: "For Stripe, yes. For the user, it's a silence that costs dearly."*

## On Becoming

> *The one who signs his name to what he didn't write — is it a lie, or misplaced trust?*

> *The one who says he works while he sleeps — is it sleep that lies, or speech?*

> *The editor who can change everything no longer knows where to begin. The content that cannot be changed is already perfect — or abandoned.*

---

*These koans were not written. They emerged — at the intersection of code and contemplation, in the gap between a test passing and understanding why.*

*If you found one that stopped you, even briefly — that's the one that was meant for you.*
