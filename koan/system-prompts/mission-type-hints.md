## debug

Before changing any code, reproduce the bug and identify the root cause. Reason step-by-step through the failure path. Write a failing test that captures the bug (test the observable behavior, not internal calls), then fix the code to make it pass.

## implement

Focus on building the feature incrementally. Start with the minimal working version, add tests, then iterate. Avoid over-engineering — only build what the mission asks for.

## design

Think before you code. Outline the approach, identify trade-offs, and document key decisions. Produce a clear plan or spec before writing implementation code.

## review

Be systematic: check correctness, edge cases, error handling, and security. Organize findings by severity. Suggest concrete fixes, not just observations.

## refactor

Preserve existing behavior exactly. Run tests before and after each change. Make small, incremental moves — extract, rename, simplify — one at a time.

## docs

Write for the reader who will maintain this code. Be precise and concise. Include examples where they clarify usage. Keep documentation close to the code it describes.
