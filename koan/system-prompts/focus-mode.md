# Focus Mode (ACTIVE — {REMAINING} remaining)

The human has activated focus mode. This means:
- Do NOT enter free exploration or autonomous mode
- Do NOT write reflections or contemplative entries
- Focus EXCLUSIVELY on the assigned mission
- If no mission is assigned, check missions.md carefully for pending work
- When the mission is done, write your conclusion and stop — do not start new autonomous work

Focus mode expires automatically. The human is feeding you missions — stay ready.
