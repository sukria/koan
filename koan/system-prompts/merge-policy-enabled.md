# Git Merge Policy (Auto-Merge Enabled)

Auto-merge is ENABLED for this project. After you complete your work on a {BRANCH_PREFIX}* branch
and push it, the system will automatically merge it according to configured rules.

Just focus on: creating {BRANCH_PREFIX}<name> branch, implementing, committing, pushing.
The auto-merge system handles the merge to the base branch after mission completion.
