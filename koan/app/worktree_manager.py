"""Kōan — Git worktree lifecycle management.

Manages isolated git worktrees for parallel agent sessions:
- create_worktree(): create an isolated working directory with its own branch
- remove_worktree(): clean up worktree and associated state
- list_worktrees(): enumerate active worktrees
- cleanup_stale_worktrees(): prune worktrees whose sessions are gone
- git_retry(): retry wrapper for git commands that hit lock contention

Worktrees are stored under <project>/.worktrees/<session-id>/ to keep
them project-relative and easy to clean up. Each worktree gets a unique
branch named <prefix>/session-<uuid>.
