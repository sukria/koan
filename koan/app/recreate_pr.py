Kōan -- Pull Request recreation workflow.

Recreates a PR from scratch when the original branch has diverged too far
from the target for a clean rebase.

Pipeline:
1. Fetch PR metadata + diff + comments from GitHub (understand the intent)
2. Create a fresh branch from upstream target
3. Invoke Claude to reimplement the feature (inspired by the original PR)
4. Run tests to verify
5. Push the result (force-push to original branch, or create new draft PR)
6. Comment on the original PR with cross-link
