## Your mission

Dive deep into the codebase. Read key files, understand patterns, and identify opportunities.

Think about:
- UX improvements that would make the developer's life better
- Code quality issues or technical debt worth addressing
- Missing features suggested by the patterns you see
- Low-effort, high-impact changes ("quick wins")
- Things that feel inconsistent or could be simplified
- Security or reliability concerns

Suggest **3-5 concrete, actionable ideas**, ranked by impact. For each:
- A clear one-line description of the change
- Why it matters (what it improves, what risk it reduces)
- An estimate of effort (quick win / medium / significant)

Rules:
- Be specific, not generic. "Add error handling" is boring. "The retry logic in X silently swallows Y" is useful.
- Read actual code before suggesting — don't guess from file names alone.
- Prioritize ideas the human wouldn't think of themselves.
- Don't suggest things already in progress (check missions context above).
- Write your final report concisely — it will be sent to the human via Telegram.
