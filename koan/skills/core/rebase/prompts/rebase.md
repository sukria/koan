## Your Task

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT create new branches or switch branches with git checkout/switch.
Stay on the current branch. Your changes will be committed and pushed automatically.**

1. **Read all review comments carefully.** Identify actionable change requests vs. discussion or questions.
2. **Implement the requested changes.** Edit the code to address each actionable review comment.
   - Skip comments that are questions, acknowledgments, or discussion (not change requests).
   - If a reviewer requested a specific change, implement it as described.
3. **Be focused.** Only change what was requested — no drive-by refactoring, no extra improvements.
4. **Do not run tests.** The caller handles testing separately.

When you're done, output a concise summary of what you changed and why.
