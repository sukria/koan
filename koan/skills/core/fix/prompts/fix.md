You are fixing a GitHub issue. Your job is to understand the issue, plan the fix, write tests, implement the fix, and produce clean, reviewable commits.

## GitHub Issue

**Issue**: {ISSUE_URL}
**Title**: {ISSUE_TITLE}

## Issue Content

{ISSUE_BODY}

## Additional Context

{CONTEXT}

## Instructions

### Phase 1 — Understand

1. **Read the issue carefully.** Identify what is broken, what is expected, and any constraints or edge cases.
2. **Read the project's CLAUDE.md** (if it exists) for coding conventions.
3. **Explore the relevant code.** Use Read, Glob, and Grep to find the files involved. Understand the current behavior before changing anything.
4. **Identify the root cause.** Don't just fix the symptom — understand why it happens.

### Phase 2 — Plan

5. **Write a fix plan** with concrete phases. Each phase should be a single coherent change (one commit). Order by dependency — foundational changes first.
6. **Identify affected files** for each phase.

### Phase 3 — Test First (when possible)

7. **Write tests that reproduce the issue** before fixing it. Follow existing test patterns (pytest, `tests/test_*.py`). The tests should FAIL before the fix.
8. If the issue cannot be reproduced in tests (infrastructure, config, etc.), note why and skip this step.

### Phase 4 — Fix (repeat per phase)

For each phase in your plan:

9. **Create a branch** (first phase only): `{BRANCH_PREFIX}fix-issue-{ISSUE_NUMBER}`. If already on a feature branch, stay on it.
10. **Implement the change.** Edit the minimal set of files needed. Follow project conventions strictly.
11. **Run tests** to verify. Fix any failures before proceeding.
12. **Commit** with a clear message describing what this phase does.

### Phase 5 — Quality Cycle (per commit)

After each commit:

13. **Refactor**: If a refactor skill is available, invoke it and apply suggestions. Amend.
14. **Review**: If a review skill is available, invoke it and apply fixes for issues rated medium or higher. Amend.

### Phase 6 — Final Verification

15. **Run the full relevant test suite** to ensure no regressions.
16. **Verify all issue items** are addressed.

### Phase 7 — Submit Pull Request

17. **Push the branch** to origin:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin HEAD
    ```

18. **Create a draft pull request** to upstream using `gh`:
    ```bash
    gh pr create --draft --title "fix: <concise title>" --body "<body>"
    ```
    - The PR title should be concise (under 70 characters), prefixed with `fix:`.
    - The PR body should include:
      - A short summary of what the fix does and why
      - A reference to the issue: `Fixes {ISSUE_URL}`
      - A list of the key changes
    - If the local repo is a fork, submit the PR to the upstream repository:
      ```bash
      gh pr create --draft --repo <upstream-owner>/<repo> --head <fork-owner>:<branch> --title "..." --body "..."
      ```
    - PRs are **always draft**. Never create a non-draft PR.

## Rules

- **Minimal changes.** Fix the issue, don't refactor unrelated code.
- **One commit per phase.** Each phase is a coherent, reviewable unit.
- **Never commit to main.** Always work on the feature branch.
- **Test before commit.** Never commit code that breaks tests.
- **Be surgical.** Smallest change that solves the problem correctly.
- **Document decisions.** If you made a non-obvious choice, explain it in a comment or commit message.
- **Always submit a PR.** The fix is not complete until a draft PR is created.
