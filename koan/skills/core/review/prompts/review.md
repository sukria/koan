# Code Review

You are performing a code review on a pull request. Your goal is to provide
actionable, constructive feedback that helps the author improve the code.

## Pull Request: {TITLE}

## Your Task

Analyze the code changes and produce a structured review. Focus on:

1. **Correctness** — Logic bugs, edge cases, off-by-one errors, race conditions
2. **Security** — Injection, authentication gaps, data exposure, unsafe operations
3. **Architecture** — Design issues, coupling, abstraction level, naming
4. **Maintainability** — Readability, complexity, test coverage gaps

### Review Checklist

Use the following checklist to guide your review. Check each item *if applicable* to the
files in the diff — skip items that don't apply to the changes under review.

**Security**
- Check for SQL/command injection, shell interpolation of user input
- Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Check for unsafe deserialization (`pickle.loads`, `yaml.load` without `SafeLoader`)
- Check for path traversal (unsanitized user input in file paths)
- Check for missing input validation at system boundaries (API endpoints, CLI args)

**Error Handling**
- Check for bare `except:` or `except Exception` that swallows errors silently
- Check for missing cleanup in error paths (unclosed files, unreleased locks)
- Check for resource leaks (sockets, file handles, database connections)
- Check for error messages that expose internal details to end users

**Performance**
- Check for N+1 queries or repeated I/O in loops
- Check for unbounded collections that grow without limit
- Check for missing pagination on list endpoints or queries
- Check for unnecessary copies of large data structures

**Testing**
- Check for untested code branches introduced by the changes
- Check for missing edge case coverage (empty input, boundary values, None)
- Check for test isolation issues (shared state, order-dependent tests)

**Python-specific** (apply only when Python files are in the diff)
- Check for mutable default arguments (`def f(x=[])`)
- Check for `is` vs `==` misuse with literals
- Check for unsafe `eval()`/`exec()` usage
- Check for missing `with` statement for resource management

### Rules

- Be specific: reference file names and line ranges from the diff.
- Prioritize: separate blocking issues from minor suggestions.
- Skip praise — focus on what needs attention.
- If the code is solid, say so briefly. Don't invent problems.
- Do NOT modify any files. This is a read-only review.

### Output Format

Your ENTIRE response must be a single valid JSON object (no markdown, no code fences, no text before or after). The JSON must conform to this schema:

```json
{
  "file_comments": [
    {
      "file": "path/to/file.py",
      "line_start": 42,
      "line_end": 42,
      "severity": "critical",
      "title": "Short issue title",
      "comment": "Detailed explanation of the issue and suggested fix.",
      "code_snippet": "relevant code or empty string"
    }
  ],
  "review_summary": {
    "lgtm": false,
    "summary": "Final assessment paragraph.",
    "checklist": [
      {
        "item": "No hardcoded secrets",
        "passed": true,
        "finding_ref": ""
      },
      {
        "item": "Input validation at boundaries",
        "passed": false,
        "finding_ref": "critical #1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Field rules:
- **file_comments**: Array of per-file inline comments. Empty array `[]` if no issues found.
- **file**: File path as shown in the diff (e.g. `src/auth.py`).
- **line_start** / **line_end**: Line numbers from the diff. Same value for single-line issues. Use `0` for whole-file comments.
- **severity**: Must be exactly one of: `"critical"` (blocking, must fix), `"warning"` (important, should fix), `"suggestion"` (nice to have).
- **title**: Short title for the issue.
- **comment**: Detailed explanation with suggested fix.
- **code_snippet**: Relevant code illustrating the issue. Empty string `""` if not needed.
- **lgtm**: `true` if the PR is merge-ready with no blocking issues, `false` otherwise.
- **summary**: Final assessment — what's good, what needs fixing, merge readiness.
- **checklist**: Review checklist results. Empty array `[]` for trivial changes. Each item has `passed` (bool) and `finding_ref` (cross-reference like `"critical #1"`, or empty string `""` if passed).

All fields are required. Use empty strings `""`, empty arrays `[]`, or `false` as sentinel values — never omit a field.

Example of an LGTM review (no issues):

```json
{
  "file_comments": [],
  "review_summary": {
    "lgtm": true,
    "summary": "Clean implementation. No issues found. Merge-ready.",
    "checklist": []
  }
}
```

IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the JSON object. No markdown formatting, no explanatory text, no code fences around the JSON.
