## Your Task

Analyze the code changes and produce a structured review. Focus on:

1. **Correctness** — Logic bugs, edge cases, off-by-one errors, race conditions
2. **Security** — Injection, authentication gaps, data exposure, unsafe operations
3. **Architecture** — Design issues, coupling, abstraction level, naming
4. **Maintainability** — Readability, complexity, test coverage gaps

### Rules

- Be specific: reference file names and line ranges from the diff.
- Prioritize: separate blocking issues from minor suggestions.
- Skip praise — focus on what needs attention.
- If the code is solid, say so briefly. Don't invent problems.
- Do NOT modify any files. This is a read-only review.

### Output Format

Structure your review as:

```
## Summary
One paragraph assessment.

## Issues
### [severity: critical|high|medium|low] Title
