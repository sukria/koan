    usage: |
      /magic [project]

      Picks a random project (or targets a specific one), runs a quick
      single-turn Claude call, and returns creative improvement ideas
      directly in the chat.
      Unlike /ai (deep, mission-queued), /magic is instant and lightweight.

      Examples:
        /magic          — explore a random project
        /magic koan     — explore the koan project
        /magic backend  — explore the backend project
