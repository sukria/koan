## What Is This?

You pay for Claude Max. You use it 8 hours a day. The other 16? Wasted quota.

Koan fixes that. It's a background agent that runs on your machine, pulls tasks from a shared mission queue, executes them via [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), and reports back through Telegram or Slack. It writes code in isolated branches, never touches `main`, and waits for your review before anything ships.

**The agent proposes. The human decides.**

This isn't a chatbot wrapper. It's a collaborator with memory, personality, and opinions. It tracks its own learnings across sessions, evolves its working style, and writes a zen koan at the end of every run. Because why not.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sukria/koan.git
cd koan
make install    # Interactive web wizard — sets up everything
make start      # Launches the agent loop + messaging bridge
```

That's it. Send it a mission via Telegram: *"audit the auth module for security issues"* — and go live your life.

For manual setup or advanced configuration, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## How It Works

```
         You (Telegram/Slack)
              │
              ▼
    ┌─────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐
    │    awake.py      │◄──────►│   instance/      │
    │  (msg bridge)    │        │   missions.md    │
    └─────────────────┘        │   outbox.md      │
                               │   config.yaml    │
                               └────────┬─────────┘
                                        │
                               ┌────────▼─────────┐
                               │     run.py        │
                               │  (agent loop)     │
                               └────────┬─────────┘
                                        │
                               ┌────────▼─────────┐
                               │  Your Projects    │
                               │  (koan/* branches) │
                               └──────────────────┘
```

Two processes run in parallel:

- **Bridge** (`make awake`) — Polls your messaging platform. Classifies incoming messages as *chat* (instant reply) or *mission* (queued for deep work). Formats outgoing messages through Claude with personality context.
- **Agent loop** (`make run`) — Picks the next mission, executes it via Claude Code CLI, writes journal entries, pushes branches, creates draft PRs. Adapts its work intensity based on remaining API quota.

Communication happens through shared markdown files in `instance/` — atomic writes, file locks, no database needed.

## Features

### Core

- **Multi-project support** — Up to 50 projects with per-project config, memory isolation, and smart rotation
- **Mission lifecycle** — Pending → In Progress → Done/Failed with crash recovery and stale-mission cleanup
- **Budget-aware modes** — Automatically adapts work depth based on remaining API quota:
  - **DEEP** (>40%) — Strategic work, thorough exploration
  - **IMPLEMENT** (15-40%) — Focused development, quick wins
  - **REVIEW** (<15%) — Read-only analysis, code audits
  - **WAIT** (<5%) — Graceful pause until quota resets

### Agent Intelligence

- **Smart mission picker** — Claude-based prioritization across projects (skips LLM call when trivial)
- **Persistent memory** — Session summaries, per-project learnings, personality evolution
- **Contemplative mode** — Occasional reflection sessions between missions (configurable probability)
- **Daily reports** — Digest messages at session boundaries
- **Post-mission reflection** — Writes deeper insights to a shared journal after significant work

### Git & GitHub

- **Branch isolation** — All work happens in `koan/*` branches. Never commits to `main`
- **Auto-merge** — Configurable per-project merge strategies (squash/merge/rebase)
- **Git sync awareness** — Tracks branch state, detects merges, reports sync status
- **GitHub integration** — Draft PRs, issue creation, PR reviews, rebasing — all via `gh` CLI
- **GitHub @mention triggers** — Koan responds to @mentions on issues and PRs

### Communication

- **Telegram & Slack** — Pluggable messaging with flood protection
- **Personality-aware formatting** — Every outbox message passes through Claude with soul + memory context
- **Verbose mode** — Real-time progress updates streamed to your phone
- **Spontaneous messages** — Koan occasionally initiates conversation when something feels worth saying

### Developer Experience

- **31 slash commands** — From `/plan` to `/review` to `/sparring` — see [Skills](#skills)
- **Web dashboard** — Local Flask UI for status, missions, chat, and journal browsing
- **Setup wizard** — Web-based guided setup (`make install`)
- **4500+ tests** — Comprehensive test suite with `make test`

## Skills

Skills are pluggable commands — some are instant, others spawn Claude work sessions. A few highlights:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mission <text>` | Queue a new mission |
| `/plan <desc>` | Create an implementation plan |
| `/implement <desc>` | Write code for a feature or fix |
| `/review <PR>` | Review a pull request |
| `/rebase <PR>` | Rebase a PR onto its base branch |
| `/recreate <PR>` | Re-implement a PR from scratch on a fresh branch |
| `/check <project>` | Run project health checks |
| `/claudemd` | Refresh a project's CLAUDE.md |
| `/refactor <desc>` | Targeted refactoring mission |
| `/sparring` | Strategic challenge — not code, thinking |
| `/reflect <msg>` | Write to the shared journal |
| `/status` | Quick status overview |
| `/focus <project>` | Lock agent to one project |
| `/quota` | Check API usage and budget |
| `/journal` | Read today's journal entries |
| `/verbose` / `/silent` | Toggle real-time updates |

Full list: run `/help` in Telegram. Skills are extensible — drop a `SKILL.md` in `instance/skills/` or install from a Git repo with `/skill install <url>`.

See [koan/skills/README.md](koan/skills/README.md) for the authoring guide.

## Configuration

All behavioral config lives in `instance/config.yaml`. Secrets stay in `.env`.

```yaml
# How hard should Kōan work
max_runs_per_day: 10
interval_seconds: 60

# Model selection per role
models:
  mission: null        # Default (sonnet)
  chat: null           # Default (sonnet)
  lightweight: haiku   # Quick tasks (formatting, picking)

# Budget thresholds
budget:
  warn_at_percent: 20
  stop_at_percent: 5
```

### Multi-Project Setup

Define your projects in `projects.yaml` at `KOAN_ROOT`:

```yaml
defaults:
  git_auto_merge:
    enabled: false

projects:
  webapp:
    path: ~/Code/webapp
  api:
    path: ~/Code/api
    cli_provider: copilot    # Per-project provider override
    models:
      mission: opus
```

### CLI Providers

Koan isn't locked to Claude. Swap the backend per-project:

| Provider | Best for |
|----------|----------|
| **Claude Code** (default) | Full-featured agent, best reasoning |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Teams with existing Copilot licenses |
| **Local LLM** | Offline, privacy, zero API cost |

See provider guides in [docs/](docs/).

  tests/                  # 4500+ tests (pytest)
instance/                 # Your private data (gitignored)
  soul.md                 #   Agent personality — this is who Kōan is
  missions.md             #   Task queue
  config.yaml             #   Behavioral settings
  memory/                 #   Persistent context across sessions
  journal/                #   Daily logs (YYYY-MM-DD/project.md)
```

**Design principle:** Code is generic and open source. Instance data is private. Fork the repo, write your own soul.

## Philosophy

Koan was born from a simple question: *what do you do with a Claude Max subscription when you're not at your desk?*

The answer: you build a collaborator. Not an assistant — a sparring partner. One that reads your code before suggesting changes, tracks its own mistakes, and has the spine to say *"I think this is wrong"* when it means it.

It works in `koan/*` branches. It never merges to `main`. It writes a journal. It evolves. And at the end of every session, it writes a koan — a zen question born from the work it just did. Because reflection matters more than velocity.

*The agent proposes. The human decides.*

## Security

Koan is designed for **local, single-user operation**. It is not a web service.

- All work happens in isolated `koan/*` branches — your `main` is never modified
- Chat tools are restricted (read-only) vs. mission tools (full access) to limit prompt injection surface
- Dashboard binds to `localhost` only — no external access by default
- Telegram/Slack auth uses platform-level identity verification

Do not expose Koan services to the public internet. For remote access, use SSH tunnels.
