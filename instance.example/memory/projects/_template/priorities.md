# Project Priorities

<!--
This file guides Kōan's DEEP mode autonomous work.
Without priorities, Kōan defaults to generic work (tests, refactoring).
With priorities, Kōan focuses on what actually matters to you.

Update this file as priorities shift. Kōan reads it before every DEEP session.
-->

## Current Focus

<!--
What matters most RIGHT NOW? List 1-3 items max.
Be specific: "Implement Stripe webhook retry" beats "improve payments"
-->

- (What's the most important thing to work on?)

## Strategic Goals

<!--
Bigger picture goals for the next weeks/months.
These help Kōan understand what kind of work moves the needle.
-->

- (What are you trying to achieve with this project?)

## Technical Debt

<!--
Known issues that should be addressed when budget allows.
Kōan may tackle these during DEEP autonomous sessions.
-->

- (What tech debt do you know about?)

## Do Not Touch

<!--
Areas Kōan should AVOID working on autonomously.
Examples: legacy code being deprecated, modules under active development by you
-->

- (What should Kōan leave alone?)

## Notes

<!--
Any context that helps Kōan make better decisions.
Examples: "We're launching feature X soon, don't refactor that area"
-->

(Additional context for Kōan)
