# Kōan Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Values starting with "CHANGE:" must be updated before running.
# Kōan will work with sensible defaults for most other settings.

# Paths — these are mostly set via environment variables now.
# You can override here if needed, but KOAN_PROJECT_PATH / KOAN_PROJECTS
# in .env is the preferred method.
# project_path: "/path/to/your/project"
# pilot_repo: "/path/to/koan"

# Budget & Scheduling
# These are the primary source of truth for run loop configuration.
# max_runs_per_day: Maximum runs before auto-pause (resets on /resume or quota reset)
# interval_seconds: Seconds between runs (how often the loop iterates)
max_runs_per_day: 20
interval_seconds: 300

# Fast reply mode — use lightweight model (Haiku) for command handlers
# When true, /usage, /sparring, and similar commands use Haiku instead of default model
# Faster response, lower cost, but simpler answers
fast_reply: false

# Debug mode — write detailed mission execution logs to .koan-debug.log
# Use `tail -f .koan-debug.log` to watch dispatch decisions, commands, and errors
# debug: false

# Branch prefix — used for all agent-created branches
# Default is "koan" which creates branches like "koan/fix-something"
# Change this for multi-bot setups to avoid branch name collisions
# e.g., "koan-alice" creates branches like "koan-alice/fix-something"
# branch_prefix: "koan"

# Contemplative mode trigger chance (0-100%)
# When no mission is pending, this is the probability of running a reflective
# session instead of autonomous work. Allows regular moments of introspection
# without waiting for budget exhaustion.
# 0 = never contemplative, 10 = ~1 in 10 runs, 20 = ~1 in 5 runs
contemplative_chance: 10

# Telegram
# NOTE: Prefer setting these in .env (KOAN_TELEGRAM_TOKEN, KOAN_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID)
# These config values are only used if the env vars are not set.
telegram:
  bot_token: ""   # Set via KOAN_TELEGRAM_TOKEN in .env (recommended)
  chat_id: ""     # Set via KOAN_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID in .env (recommended)

# Usage thresholds
budget:
  warn_at_percent: 70   # Send warning via Telegram
  stop_at_percent: 85   # Stop running

# Claude tools configuration
# SECURITY: Chat and missions have separate tool sets to prevent prompt injection.
# Telegram messages are untrusted input — they only get read-only tools.
tools:
  # Chat tools — restricted set for Telegram/dashboard conversations
  # Default is read-only: no Bash, Edit, or Write to prevent prompt injection
  chat: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"]
  # Mission tools — full access for autonomous execution
  mission: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "Edit", "Write", "Bash"]
  description: |
    Available capabilities:
    - File operations: Read, Edit, Write files in the project
    - Search: Glob (find files), Grep (search content)
    - Shell: Bash (run git, gh, make, and other commands)

# CLI provider — which AI CLI to use as the backend
# Options: "claude" (default), "copilot" (GitHub Copilot CLI), "local" (local LLM)
# Can also be set via KOAN_CLI_PROVIDER env var (overrides this)
cli_provider: "claude"

# Local LLM configuration (used when cli_provider: "local")
# Connects to any OpenAI-compatible API server:
#   - Ollama:     http://localhost:11434/v1
#   - llama.cpp:  http://localhost:8080/v1
#   - LM Studio:  http://localhost:1234/v1
#   - vLLM:       http://localhost:8000/v1
# Can also be set via KOAN_LOCAL_LLM_* env vars (override config values)
# local_llm:
#   base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1"
#   model: "glm4"
#   api_key: ""   # Usually empty for local servers

# Claude model configuration
# Controls which models are used for different types of Claude calls
# Empty string = use default model (subscription default or ANTHROPIC_MODEL)
models:
  mission: ""              # Main mission execution (empty = default)
  chat: ""                 # Telegram/dashboard chat responses
  lightweight: "haiku"     # Low-cost calls: format_outbox, pick_mission, contemplative
  fallback: "sonnet"       # Fallback when primary model is overloaded (print mode only)
  review_mode: ""          # Override model for REVIEW mode (cheaper audits)

# Git auto-merge configuration
# Automatically merges koan/* branches based on rules
git_auto_merge:
  enabled: false                    # Global on/off switch
  base_branch: "main"               # Default target branch for merges
  strategy: "squash"                # merge | squash | rebase
  rules:
    - pattern: "koan/*"             # Branch name pattern (glob-style)
      auto_merge: true              # Enable auto-merge for matching branches
      delete_after_merge: true      # Clean up branch after successful merge

# Schedule — control when deep exploration vs mission-only work happens
# deep_hours: time ranges for deep/contemplative work (higher exploration chance)
# work_hours: time ranges for mission-only work (exploration suppressed)
# Format: "START-END" using 24h hours. Wraps around midnight: "22-6".
# Multiple ranges: "0-6,22-24". Leave empty to disable.
# Example: deep exploration at night (0-6), missions only during work day (8-20)
# schedule:
#   deep_hours: "0-6"
#   work_hours: "8-20"

# Log rotation — controls backup behavior when processes restart
# Previous logs are preserved as numbered backups (.log.1, .log.2, etc.)
# Older backups (.log.2+) are gzip-compressed to save disk space
# logs:
#   max_backups: 3          # Number of old log files to keep (default: 3)
#   max_size_mb: 50         # Max size per backup in MB (default: 50)
#   compress: true          # Gzip-compress backups .log.2+ (default: true)

# Usage estimation (auto-calibration from Claude JSON output)
# Tune these limits based on your Claude plan by comparing
# estimated % with actual /usage output in Claude CLI
usage:
  session_token_limit: 500000   # Tokens per 5h session window
  weekly_token_limit: 5000000   # Tokens per 7-day window

# Per-project overrides are now configured in projects.yaml.
# Supported per-project settings:
#   - git_auto_merge: per-project merge rules
#   - cli_provider: override AI provider ("claude", "copilot", "local")
#   - models: override model selection (mission, chat, lightweight, etc.)
#   - tools: restrict available tools (mission, chat tool lists)
#   - github: override authorized_users for GitHub @mention commands
# See projects.example.yaml for documentation and examples.

# GitHub notification-driven commands
# Enable Kōan to respond to @mentions in GitHub PR/issue comments.
# When a user posts "@nickname rebase" in a PR comment, Kōan reacts with 👍,
# creates a mission, and processes it in the next iteration.
# github:
#   nickname: "koan-bot"            # Bot's GitHub @mention name (required if enabled)
#   commands_enabled: false          # Master switch (default: false)
#   authorized_users: ["*"]          # "*" = all users, or list of GitHub usernames
#   max_age_hours: 24                # Ignore notifications older than this (default: 24)
